        <p>We are the Surrey Peer Education Project (SPED) for Looked After Young People in Surrey.  We meet every other Monday during the evenings. Checkout our calendar to see when the next meeting will be.</p>

<p>We are re-launching to include healthy lifestyles and key skills. This will also include a younger age group going from 14+ to provide them with the opportunity to learn about healthy lifestyles and key skills such as: cooking, finances, school, time management, revision and stress. We hope this will be more enjoyable and interesting for young people.</p>

<p>We sometimes hold our meetings in one of Surrey's community homes. The members of the community homes will be offered the opportunity to join the project whilst at the community home. If they like the project and wish to carry on attending then they can come along to the meetings.</p>

<p>If you are interested in joining the project please contact us!</p>
